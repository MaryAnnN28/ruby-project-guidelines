     "The first three-point shot in the NBA was made by Boston Celtics guard Chris Ford on October 12, 1979, against the Houston Rockets."
     "Steals and blocks only became official (recorded) stats in the NBA starting from the 1973-1974 season. During that season, Elmore Smith recored the most blocks in an NBA game with 17 on October 28, 1973."
     "The 24-second shot clock was the brainchild of Syracuse Nationals owner Danny Biasone and general manager Leo Ferris. The NBA first adopted the shot clock during the 1954-1955 season."
     "There have been two women drafted in the NBA. The first was Denise Long who was drafted in the 13th round by the San Francisco Warriors. The second was Luisa Harris, who was drafted by the New Orleans Jazz as the 137th overall draft pick"
