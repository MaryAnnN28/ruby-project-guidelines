### About the Developers
Mary Ann & Andres, both NBA fans (Sixers and Spurs fans respectively) with a love for NBA stats and analytics, were the perfect pair, just 3 weeks before the start of the 2020-2021 NBA season. Their goal was to provide both analytics and data hungry NBA fans with a resource that both customizes their user's home page specific to their favorite team, or selected team, along with viewing all key stats for all 30 teams and players.
